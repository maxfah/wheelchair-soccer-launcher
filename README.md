# Wheelchair Soccer Launcher

![The completed wheelchair-mounted soccer ball launcher](/images/wheelchair-soccer-launcher-side.png)

This project is an open-source soccer ball launcher designed to be mounted on a wheelchair. It was developed by students from the **[Waukee APEX Program](https://apex.waukeeschools.org/)** to support the amazing work of [**Can Play**](https://can-play.org/), a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing adaptive sports and recreation opportunities for children and adults with disabilities.

The goal of this project is to provide a low-cost, accessible, and replicable design that allows more individuals to participate in wheelchair soccer.

## Getting Started & Full Documentation

All the files and instructions needed to build your own launcher can be found at the links below.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

This document is split into two parts to make acquiring components as easy as possible:

  * The **Project Component List** details every single part used in the final assembly.

  * The **Purchase List** is a shopping list of the items you need to buy, often in packages that contain more parts than required for a single build.

  * **[bill-of-materials.md](/bill-of-materials.md)** | **[bill-of-materials.xlsx](/bill-of-materials.xlsx)** 

### 3D Models

All 3D printable parts are available below. Files are available in `.step`, `.f3d`, `.3mf`, and individual `.stl` formats. The designs were created using Fusion 360.
